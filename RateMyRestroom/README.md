# RateMyRestroom

To launch our application from scratch:

1. navigate to RateMyRestroom directory
2. run npm install
optimally you would have 2 terminals for the following steps:
3. navigate to the server subfolder of RateMyRestroom and run "npm start"
4. navigate to the src subfolder of RateMyRestroom and run "npm start"
5. utilize the Expo QR code within Expo Go app on a mobile device to emulate/run our app
6. if app doesn't load shake phone and select refresh from list

Tests can be performed as follows:
1. In the terminal while within RateMyRestroom, type: "npm test"
2. To view a code coverage analysis, in the terminal type: "npx jest --coverage"

Expected functionality in final app:
1. user can properly create an account and login
2. view restrooms that are already in the database

Almost functional besides some front end calls:
3. submit reviews for those restrooms
4. submit new restrooms
